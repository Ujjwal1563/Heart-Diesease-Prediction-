# Heart-Disease-Prediction
## Overview
The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics. The project leverages logistic regression to analyze patient data and provide a risk assessment for heart disease.

## Features
- Predict the risk of heart disease based on patient data.
- User authentication to secure access to the system.
- Visualize important health metrics and their impact on predictions.
- Generate a QR code for quick access to patient predictions.
- Customizable URL for accessing patient data.
- Display statistics about prediction accuracy and user engagement.
